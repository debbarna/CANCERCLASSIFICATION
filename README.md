# ðŸ§¬ Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on classifying cancer types using machine learning techniques applied to clinical, genomic, or imaging data. The aim is to support early diagnosis and improve treatment planning by accurately distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors (or among multiple cancer subtypes).

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

We use publicly available cancer datasets such as:

- **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)** dataset from UCI ML Repository  

Each dataset includes features extracted from tissue samples or images and corresponding cancer labels (e.g., benign vs. malignant).

## ðŸ§  Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- XGBoost (optional)
